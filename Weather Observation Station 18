Consider p1(a,b) and p2(c,d)  to be two points on a 2D plane.

 a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 
 Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.
 
 
 select round(max(lat_n)-min(lat_n) + max(long_w)-min(long_w), 4) 
from Station;
